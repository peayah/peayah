### 3 Reasons I Love To Code ...
**Reason #1:** I love to code because it is a craft and an art. Like with other crafts there are basic skills you need to learn and master in order to produce a viable product. When you then get beyond the basics and are able to use and combine those skills to create something that touches peoples lives, or even create something that didn't exist before . That is when coding becomes an art. And that is an amazing feeling.

**Reason #2:** I love to code because it is constant problem solving. Every challenge solved is a lesson that makes me a better programmer. And the sense of satisfaction that comes with solving a complicated problem can't be beaten -- and usually calls for loud cheer.

**Reason #3:** I love to code because it is constant learning. It is not that programming languages changes constantly, because they don't. HTML, CSS and JavaScript still rule the net. But rather it is the way we use and combine the tools that is constantly changing.
